            <h2>Challenge and objective</h2>
            <p>The challenge was to select a physical product and design an online store that only sells that product, to create an online donut shop that contains the various interfaces associated with the product itself.</p>

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <div class="analysis">
                <h3>Analysis and Discovery</h3> 
                <p>We analysed more than 20 websites to help us understand the market and the users, their needs and goals and also we did some interviews and user flows.</p>
                <p>We took all the research and separated it by themes to understand the main problems and how to get to the solution and developed some personas and responded to how might we’s that helped us get some good solutions.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="ideation">
                <h3>Ideation</h3>
                <p>After we analysed how to put the streams menu inside Spotify was time to explore all the potential of this medium.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>New formats:</strong>Clubs and Coffees, Meet and Great and Join and Jam.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Chat:</strong>Allows the user to connect with other people that are watching the same experience and also with the artist. It creates a more intimate experience and enables them to express their feelings and thoughts live.</li>
                    <li><strong>The PlayAlong:</strong>With this feature the user can play along with the artists and create their own music remixes by playing different instruments and changing the scale, timing and rhythm. Only the user can hear what they’re producing so that the concert can keep its integrity.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Multi Cameras:</strong>In a normal concert setting fans are constrained by the site that they purchase. With the Multi-Cameras system they can change viewpoints and perspectives in the building. They can be closer to the singer, paddle down with the drummer or observe closely that one amazing guitar solo from their favorite musician.</li>

            <h2>Final Soluction</h2>
            <p>With the development of the final mockup we can see the color schemes, content layouts, fonts, icons, navigation visuals, images, and the overall feeling of the future software product design and user experience. It’s really important to see the work coming to life. I tried to create mockups that are...</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Convincing</li>
                <li>Realistic</li>
                <li>Easy to revise</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And also they offer a great opportunity to study the results of the design decisions made previously.</p>
