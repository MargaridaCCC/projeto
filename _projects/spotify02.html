            <h2>About the project</h2>
            <p>Welcome to spotify streaming video feature. With this project we created a hub of online concerts and experiences with features that create unique moments putting the audience and artist closer.</p>
            <p><strong>My role:</strong> UI and UX Designer with especial focus on User Research</p>
            <p><strong>Other team members:</strong> Marcelo Vendramel e Patrícia Custódio</p>

            <h2>Challenge and objective</h2>
            <p>With the pandemic all concerts had to be cancelled. Streaming videos appeared as an alternative for artists to create more connection with the audience and also as
            an additional source of income.</p>
            <p>One line concerts and physical are totally different experiences so it’s positive to create a new feature in the area of streaming and also the connection between the audience and the artists can’t be replicated. But should be rethinked for sure.</p>
            <p>Spotify is a one stop shop for streaming music and already has lists of concerts with external links to buy tickets. Spotify doesn’t only have music but also podcasts adding streaming would be a new form of entertainment that would add to their mission of unlocking the potential of human creativity and spirit of discovery.</p>

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <div class="analysis">
                <h3>Analysis and Discovery</h3> 
                <p>We analysed more than 20 websites to help us understand the market and the users, their needs and goals and also we did some interviews and user flows.</p>
                <p>We took all the research and separated it by themes to understand the main problems and how to get to the solution and developed some personas and responded to how might we’s that helped us get some good solutions.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="ideation">
                <h3>Ideation</h3>
                <p>After we analysed how to put the streams menu inside Spotify was time to explore all the potential of this medium.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>New formats:</strong>Clubs and Coffees, Meet and Great and Join and Jam.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Chat:</strong>Allows the user to connect with other people that are watching the same experience and also with the artist. It creates a more intimate experience and enables them to express their feelings and thoughts live.</li>
                    <li><strong>The PlayAlong:</strong>With this feature the user can play along with the artists and create their own music remixes by playing different instruments and changing the scale, timing and rhythm. Only the user can hear what they’re producing so that the concert can keep its integrity.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Multi Cameras:</strong>In a normal concert setting fans are constrained by the site that they purchase. With the Multi-Cameras system they can change viewpoints and perspectives in the building. They can be closer to the singer, paddle down with the drummer or observe closely that one amazing guitar solo from their favorite musician.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

        <div class="spotify_content">
            <h2>Final Soluction</h2>
            <p>Streams: The Streams homepage has a menu with all the new formats.  We also added a video on top to make the page more dynamic and to encourage the user to explore more. We added a list of recommendations for most popular experiences like concerts or meet & greats.</p>
            <p><strong>Virtual Concerts:</strong>Like the streams page we also added a video on the top alongside, filters, list of past popular concerts with a preview that users can rewatch, list of upcoming virtual concerts.</p>
            <p><strong>Concerts:</strong>During the concert  the user has the option to watch it full screen and use the new features: chat, play along and multi-camera view.</p>
            <p><strong>Payment:</strong>In the payment section we ask the user to choose the currency, number of tickets and the email where they want to receive confirmation of purchase. We also added cards with the different types of tickets so that the user can easily compare them.</p>
            <p><strong>My tickets:</strong>Inside the profile we added the My Tickets page where the user can keep track of the tickets bought for upcoming and previous events. If the artist makes it possible the audience can rewatch a previous show.</p>
