            <h3>Analysis and Discovery</h3> 
            <p>During this first stage we did some website analysis, Information architecture and user flows so understand better what we were working on. But we also did some benchmarking, interviews and created personas to start building some ideias. All of this in association with the analysis of other preview projects and the data from the google analytics, help us create a new view on the project.</p>

            <h3>Ideation</h3>
            <p>In stage two, we started to brainstorm and choose some ideas that could have some potential and finally we decided to implement 6 solutions that materialized through some sketches, wireframes and mockups.</p>

            <h2>Final Soluction</h2>
            <p>The changes were mainly focused on improving the intuitivity of geral structure and relevance of sections (identified as one main issue with the current solution of the website).</p>
            <p>On the footer we added breadcrumbs to help with website navigation, as well as the newsletter subscription button, making it easy to access and keep in touch with FBAUL.</p>
            <p>The alumni section is intended to function as a digital space to give visibility to news related to the activities of former students giving both Alumni and current students the chance to be up to date and get in contact with fellow artists and professionals in their areas.</p>
            <p>The folio showcase their best work and contacts. Here, we focused on coming up with an appealing layout, a profile page and search filters for various types to work and people, to help users find what they want.</p>
            <p>The opportunities aimed to create a digital space for the creation and promotion of new opportunities such as internships, contests and artistic residency programs.</p>
