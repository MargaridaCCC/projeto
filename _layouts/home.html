            <h1>Product Designer</h1>
            <q>What was considered bold was just the difficulty of doing a certain thing. Thatâ€™s why freedom is, in fact, the impossibility of following the path taken by everyone; freedom consists in following the path that personal qualities lead us to take.</q>
